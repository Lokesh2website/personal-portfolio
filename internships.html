                <li>I played a pivotal role in spearheading the 'Service Calls Dashboard' project, an initiative aimed at significantly improving the accuracy of our service call reporting. Through the implementation of robust data validation and cleansing techniques, we achieved an impressive 85% enhancement in the precision of our service call reports. This not only resulted in greater data integrity but also led to more informed decision-making within the organization.</li>
                <li>One of the key achievements of this project was the extraction of service call data from our SQL server, followed by the development of 18 interactive visualizations using Microsoft Power BI. These visualizations provided a user-friendly and comprehensive view of the data, making it easier for stakeholders to access and understand critical information.</li>
                <li>In addition to my technical contributions, I had the privilege of managing a dedicated team comprising three members. Together, we fostered a collaborative work environment that encouraged open communication and coordinated efforts. This teamwork was instrumental in ensuring the timely achievement of project milestones.</li>
                <li>The success of the 'Service Calls Dashboard' project was recognized and celebrated within the organization. Mr. Sourav Mukherjee, our HR Manager, presented me with a certification acknowledging the project's achievements and its substantial contribution to the company's operational efficiency. This recognition serves as a testament to our team's dedication and the positive impact of our work.</li>

                <li>I had the privilege of completing my internship at Edunet Foundation in collaboration with the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). During this internship, I was part of a project AI Fitness tracker. The program was IBM SkillBuild 6 Weeks Internship for Emerging Technologies in Artificial Intelligence</li>
                <li>Our main project was about creating a smart Fitness Tracker. We used advanced technology to make it easy for people to keep track of their fitness activities. This smart tracker uses clever computer programs to give accurate results, suggest personalized fitness activities, and provide useful tips. It makes the fitness journey more enjoyable. The AI-powered tracker creates a personalized fitness experience, adapting to individual users' fitness levels, goals, and preferences, ultimately empowering them to optimize their performance and achieve their fitness objectives.</li>
                <li>The AI-powered fitness tracker provides users with precise and personalized data, helping them understand their fitness progress and offering relevant suggestions for improvement. By tailoring recommendations to individual needs, the system ensures users stay motivated and committed to their fitness goals.</li>
                <li>I'm proud to say that I received a certificate from the Edunet Foundation as a recognition of my work on the Fitness Tracker project. This certificate shows that I did a good job in helping to create this innovative fitness tool.</li>
